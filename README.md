Creating a body scanner involves complex hardware and software integration and is typically used in high-secu
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;

public class BodyScanner extends JFrame {

    public BodyScanner() {
        setTitle("Body Scanner");
        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        setSize(400, 300);
        setLocationRelativeTo(null);

        JLabel scanLabel = new JLabel("Please stand in the scanner area:");
        JButton scanButton = new JButton("Start Scan");

        JPanel panel = new JPanel();
        panel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
        panel.add(scanLabel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
        panel.add(scanButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

        add(panel);

        scanButton.addActionListener(e -> startScan());
    }

    private void startScan() {
        // Simulate scanning process
        // This is where you would typically interact with hardware
        // and perform scanning operations, which isn't feasible in this example.
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Scanning in progress...", "Scanning", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
        // After the scan completes, you can display the result or take further actions
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Scan complete! No threats detected.", "Scan Result", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            BodyScanner scanner = new BodyScanner();
            scanner.setVisible(true);
        });
    }
}
This example creates a simple Swing GUI with a button that simulates starting a scan. When the button is pressed, it displays a message simulating the scanning process and then shows a message indicating the scan result.

Remember, this is purely a simulated interface and does not perform any actual body scanning. Building a real body scanner involves hardware components like sensors, X-ray systems, and sophisticated algorithms for image processing, which are beyond the scope of a simple Java program. Additionally, such systems require adherence to strict regulations and standards due to safety and privacy concerns.
